# myShare
Rest api using Node, Express, Mongo. We will build rest api for a simple file sharing app.


In this project we will build APIs for a file sharing app using Node Js, Express Js and Mongo DB. 

We will learn how to upload a file in Node Js. For that we will use a package called Multer.

We will also use nodemailer to send emails using free SMTP from our node server.

We will also schedule a script on the server so we could delete 24 hours old files from the storage. i.e.= script.js
